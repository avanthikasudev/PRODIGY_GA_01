# 🧠 Text Generation Using GPT-2

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI’s GPT-2 model on a custom text dataset using Hugging Face Transformers. The goal is to generate contextually relevant and coherent text based on input prompts. The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
